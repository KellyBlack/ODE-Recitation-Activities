  \begin{problem}

  \item A spring mass system is constructed. The mass is 0.1 kg. The
    spring is stretched 0.04 m when the mass is hung vertically from
    the spring. The force due to air friction is estimated to be 0.03
    N when the object is moving at 0.2 m/sec. The system is placed in
    a horizontal orientation, and the object is pulled so that the
    spring extends 0.03 m and released from rest.

    \begin{subproblem}
      \item Determine the governing equation for the system. (This
        includes the initial conditions.)
        \vfill

      \item Determine the \textit{general} solution to the differential
        equation. (Do not consider the initial conditions yet.)
        \vfill

        \clearpage

      \item Determine the specific solution to match the initial conditions.

        \vfill

      \item Determine a different value for the spring constant so
        that the system will oscillate with a period of 1.2 seconds.

\begin{problem}
\item A spring mass system is constructed. The mass is $m$ kg. The
  spring is stretched 0.04 m when the mass is hung vertically from the
  spring. The air friction coefficient is $b$.

    \begin{subproblem}
      \item Determine the governing equation for the system. 
        \vfill

      \item Determine the characteristic equation for the differential
        equation. (Do not consider the initial conditions yet.)
        \vfill

        \clearpage

      \item Assume that the solution to the characteristic equation
        will be a complex number so that the system will
        oscillate. Break the solutions into two pieces, the real and
        the imaginary parts.

        \vfill

      \item Find and solve the system of equations that result for $m$
        and $b$ if you wish the amplitude of the system to decay like
        $e^{-t/10}$ and the system to oscillate with a period of 3.1
        seconds.
